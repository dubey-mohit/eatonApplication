## Description

To create the App I have followed the following steps.

1. Create new App using ng new "app_name".

2. Add the angular material using npm install angular/material.

3. Add the boostrap using npm install bootstrap.

4. Used Angular Material table to show the data in the table.

5. Added routing to show dummy data on click of tabs, except the Resource tab.

6. On click of Resource Tab the main window of web page opens.

7. Used images to show the data in table.

8. Made Header part fixed while scrolling the page.
 
9. Added static data in the Header, beacuse same image was not available.
